\chapter{Work Plan}
\label{cha:work_plan}

%Grant started on 1st december 2019, 42 months.
%So originally ends at 1st june 2023. Add another 6 months. 1st december 2023
%So another 2-3 months of covid... 1st march 2024?

\todo{Do I need to mention here the challenges/difficulties to address? I feel like that was already mentioned in the Research Statement.}

In this section we describe how we plan to make usage of the remaining time until the end of the PhD.
Table \ref{table:work_plan} shows the distribution of time for each task left.
We have described the challenges of each task in Chapter \ref{cha:research_statement}.

\todo{I will make some scheme similar to the one done for the grant when this is more well defined. The current table is just temporary.}
\todo{Should I in the plan mention about our submission to VLDB? Like have that be part of the table/figure?}
\todo{A concern of mine is that adding ``consistency levels'' may imply changes to dynamic partitioning.}

A lot of work has already been done in the context of evaluating PotionDB, namely by implementing TPC-H's benchmark and other test clients.
We believe this will make the next evaluating steps quicker and smoother, as the testing setup can be leveraged on for the next steps.
Our evaluation will be done in the Grid'5000 testbed, which allows to make usage of multiple machines to run instances of PotionDB on.
Latency from geo-distribution can be simulated by imposing latency on the links, which was already done in our experiments.

\todo{Do I need to make any special reference to Grid 5000?}

There is some considerable overlap between dynamic partitioning and consistency levels.
This happens as supporting different consistency models and/or invariants may have impacts on how dynamic partitioning works, thus we need to make sure our partitioning algorithm can cope with different consistency guarantees.

Results obtained during the course of this work will be published in top-venue conferences.
At the moment, a submission to VLDB is being prepared, hence the extensive evaluation work already done.
We plan to do other submissions to other conferences.
Interesting publication targets besides VLDB include, for example, OSDI, SOSP, EuroSys, PODC and DISC.


%Self TODO: justify small testing periods with all the preparation already done with TPC-H to support testing
